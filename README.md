It's designed for both developers who need a powerful scripting tool and users who prefer a straightforward visual application.<p align="center"><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://placehold.co/800x500/2d3748/e2e8f0%3Ftext%3DGUI%2520Screenshot%2520Here" alt="GUI Screenshot" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);"><br><em>The user-friendly GUI for real-time proxy analysis.</em></p>✨ Key Features🚀 Concurrent & Fast: Utilizes threading to check hundreds of proxies in seconds.🖥️ Dual Interface: Choose between a powerful CLI for scripting and a user-friendly GUI for interactive use.📥 Multiple Input Sources: Load proxies from a local file, a remote URL, or paste them directly as text.📊 Comprehensive Metrics: Measures average latency (ping) and stability (jitter) for each proxy.🌍 Geolocation: Automatically detects the proxy's country of origin using ip-api.com.🔎 Advanced Filtering: Filter results by maximum ping, country, and select the top N best proxies.💾 Flexible Output: Save the list of healthy proxies as .txt, .csv, or .json.🛠️ InstallationTo get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. A virtual environment is highly recommended to avoid conflicts with other projects.Clone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/vafaeim/advanced-proxy-checker.git](https://github.com/vafaeim/advanced-proxy-checker.git)
cd advanced-proxy-checker
Create and activate a virtual environment:# For macOS & Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies from requirements.txt:pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 UsageYou can run the application using either the GUI or the CLI.Graphical User Interface (GUI)For an interactive experience, run the gui.py script. The GUI provides controls for all features, a real-time results table, and easy saving of results.python src/gui.py
Command-Line Interface (CLI)The CLI is ideal for automation and integration with other scripts.python src/cli.py [INPUT_SOURCE] [OPTIONS]
Common Examples:Check proxies from a file and save the top 10 to healthy.txt:python src/cli.py proxies.txt --top 10 -o healthy.txt
Check proxies from a URL with a max ping of 500ms and filter for US-based proxies:python src/cli.py --url [https://example.com/proxies.txt](https://example.com/proxies.txt) --max-ping 500 --country US
Check proxies from a file and save the full results as a CSV file:python src/cli.py proxies.txt --csv -o results.csv
View all available commands and options:python src/cli.py --help
